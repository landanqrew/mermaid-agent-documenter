This is a test transcript of an application walkthrough.

The application has a user authentication system. When a user logs in, they provide their username and password to the login form. The frontend sends a POST request to /api/login with the credentials. The API gateway receives this request and forwards it to the authentication service.

The authentication service validates the credentials against the user database. If the credentials are valid, it generates a JWT token and returns it. The API gateway then sends the JWT back to the frontend, and the user is logged in.

If the credentials are invalid, the authentication service returns an error, and the user sees an error message.

After login, authenticated users can access protected resources by including the JWT in their requests. The API gateway validates the JWT before forwarding requests to backend services.

The system also has user registration functionality. New users can create accounts by providing email, username, and password. The registration service validates the input and creates a new user record in the database.
